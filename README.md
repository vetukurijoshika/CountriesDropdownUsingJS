# CountriesDropdownUsingJS 
Shows 3 approaches illustrating the functionality of JS in creating a dropdown of countries 

Approach 1:- Takes input text from a textbox and compares it with every country name from the <option> collection gathered using JS. Displays only those countries in the dropdown which match the input text given by the user 

Approach 2:- Using a Country Array inside <script> tag, traversing through the array and comparing the inputText and each of the country name accordingly 

Approach 3:- Beyond filtering after a button click, implemented "Events" concept, added an event listener to the inputbox which starts displaying the matching countries down belows as user starts giving an input. This eliminates the use of a button and is more modern and interactive.
